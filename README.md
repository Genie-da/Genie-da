### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Valova Evgeniya! 

Iâ€™m currently learning at the "School of Data Analysis" of Yandex Practicum in the direction of "Data analyst".

### About me
I worked as an accountant for 6 years, but I always gravitated towards analysis and statistics, so I decided to change my field of activity. I strive to study modern data research and analysis tools with the help of books, articles and practical tasks.

### Technology stack:
- I use the Python programming language.
- I use Pandas, Numpy, and Scipy to work with data.
- For visualization I use Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
- I can write SQL queries and understand the principles of relational databases.
- I've mastered cohort analysis and unit economics.
- I understand the principles of A/B testing.
